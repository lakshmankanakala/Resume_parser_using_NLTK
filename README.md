# Resume_parser
The Resume parser will convert the unstructured data to strunctured data for further usage.
I have collected some resumes who are willing to apply for a job. With these resumes, I have extracted the keywords such as   technical skills,projects,etc. using nltk (Natural Language toolkit) and TF_IDF algorithm.Then I compared these with job description then the most closest resume will be picked for further. 
Every section in the resume will be saved in a text file. 
 
 File to be run : Resume_Final.py
 
   we have modified the stops words in NLTK and created new keywords file in NLTK corpus for our resume parser.we have used regular expressions for extracting the details like Email, phone numbers etc.
